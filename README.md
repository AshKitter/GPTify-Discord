# GPTify-Discord
Using a local self-hosted ChatGPT-like model, interact with a Discord server via a bot that interfaces with the local model.

# DO NOT CREATE AN ISSUE IF YOU FORGET TO PUT YOUR TOKEN IN OR HAVE SETUP GPT4All INCORRECTLY
# I DO NOT PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR GPT4All
The model in question is GPT4All. The model has been integrated into a discord.py Python script to read chat messages and reply to them.
GPT4All is licensed under the MIT license, and I am not affiliated with GPT4All in any way whatsoever. 
GPT4All is not included with GPTify-Discord's source. Instead, I have uploaded the full folder that contains my bot's code as a release.
I have used the python wrapper example as a sample for Google's Bard AI to generate the majority of the code.
The code that was not generated through Google's Bard AI has either been generated or revised by OpenAI's ChatGPT or written by me. 
Realistically this model will not be hosted for public use due to the computational power required to run it at a fast rate. 
Please host this on your own computer, or dedicated server. Either way I don't feel comfortable hosting the Discord bot for any servers that may contain personal information as all messages are logged to the console as a result of how GPT4All's Python wrapper logs information in the console.
GPT4All's official site is https://gpt4all.io/index.html and their official GitHub repository is https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all/tree/main
